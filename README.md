# Design and implement Booths multiplication algorithm

The purpose of this project is to create a 2 by 2 
multiplier using Booth’s multiplication algorithm. 
The 2-bit multiplicand and 2-bit multiplier are 
input signals into four Booth multiplier. After 
applying Booth’s algorithm to the inputs, simple 
addition is done to produce a final output. 

Our main goal is to produce a working 2 by 2 bit 
multiplier with correct simulations and layout 
while attempting to maximize the speed in which 
the multiplier performs the calculation. 

The Booth multiplier in this code implements a 2
bit signed multiplier using Booth's algorithm. 
Booth's algorithm is used to efficiently multiply 
binary numbers, especially signed numbers..
